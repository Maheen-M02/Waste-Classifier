# üóëÔ∏è Waste Classifier (AI/ML Project)

### Classify Waste into Recyclable and Non-Recyclable Categories using Deep Learning in Google Colab

---

## üß† Overview
**Waste Classifier** is a machine learning project that automatically classifies waste images into categories such as **Organic**, **Recyclable**, and **Non-Recyclable**.  
Developed in **Google Colab**, this project applies **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning** techniques (CNN / Transfer Learning) to assist in **smart waste management** and **sustainability initiatives**.

---

## üéØ Aim
To design and implement an AI model capable of **automatically classifying waste** based on its type, promoting efficient recycling and environmental awareness.

---

## üß© Objectives
- Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.  
- Use data augmentation to improve model robustness.  
- Evaluate model accuracy and visualize predictions.  
- Provide an interactive demo for real-time classification.
